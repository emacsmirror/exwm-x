## Feature


<a id="orge77ddfe"></a>

### Appconfig

\`exwmx-appconfig' is a database manager, which is used to record and manage
appconfigs (an appconfig is a plist of application's information), when run
command \`exwmx-appconfig', a buffer with appconfig-template will be poped up,
user can edit the template and run \`exwmx-appconfig-finish' to save the change
or run \`exwmx-appconfig-ignore' to ignore the change.

All appconfigs will be saved into file: \`exwmx-appconfig-file'.

By default, every appconfig have the following keys:

1.  :command

    Record the shell command of application.

2.  :alias

    Define alias of an application, this key is used by \`exwmx-quickrun'.

3.  :pretty-name

    In EXWM and EXWM-X, an application is assocated with an emacs buffer,
    user can set the buffer's name with :pretty-name.

4.  :paste-key

    Record the paste keybinding of an application, this key is used
    by \`exwmx-sendstring'.

5.  :class

    Record the application's class, this key is used by \`exwmx-quickrun'.

6.  :instance

    Record the application's instance, this key is used by \`exwmx-quickrun'.

7.  :title

    Record the application's title, this key is used by \`exwmx-quickrun'.

8.  :floating

    If set it to \`t', application will floating when launched.

9.  :size-and-position

    If set :floating to \`t', user can use this key to set the floating window's
    size and position.
    
    Its value is a list of four elements:
    
        (width height x-pos y-pos)
    
    1.  if element >= 1, it regard as: number of pixel,
        if 0 < element < 1, it regard as: screen \* element.
    2.  user can set x-pos and y-pos to 'center, which
        mean that put the window to the center of screen.
    3.  User can set fallback value with the variable:
        \`exwmx-floating-default-size-and-position'.

10. :add-prefix-keys

    Add a key to \`exwm-input-prefix-keys' of application.

11. :remove-prefix-keys

    Remove a key from \`exwm-input-prefix-keys' of application,
    
    Note: if set it to \`t', all keys in \`exwm-input-prefix-keys'
    will be removed, this is very useful when you want to launch
    a new emacs session, this make new emacs session use **nearly**
    all the keybindings except the keybindings defined by
    \`exwmx-input-set-key'.

12. :ignore-simulation-keys

    Ingore simulation keys of application, if you set :remove-prefix-keys
    to 't, maybe you should set this option to 't too.

13. :eval

    Evaluation a expression when launch an application.

### Buttons

EXWM-X add the following **buttons** to mode-line, user can
click them to operate application's window:

1.  [X]: Delete the current application.
2.  [D]: Delete the current emacs window.
3.  [F]: Toggle floating/tilling window.
4.  [<]: Move window border to left.
5.  [+]: Maximize the current window.
6.  [>]: Move window border to right.
7.  [-]: Split window horizontal.
8.  [|]: Split window vertical.
9.  [\_]: minumize floating application
10. [Line 'XXXX'] or [L]: line-mode
11. [Char 'XXXX'] or [C]: Char-mode
12. [9][8][7][6][5]: Set the size of the floating window to 90%~50% of screen.

Note: user can use mode-line as the button-line of floating window:

    (setq exwmx-button-floating-button-line 'mode-line)


<a id="org781ea75"></a>

### Easy move/resize

By default, EXWM use "s-'down-mouse-1'" to move a floating-window
and "s-'down-mouse-3'" to resize a floating-window.

When EXWM-X is enabled, user can drag **title showed in button-line**
to move a floating-window. and click [9][8][7][6][5] in button-line
to set a floating-window's size, **without press WIN key**.

Note: button-line is mode-line or header-line of emacs.


<a id="org269542e"></a>

### Quick Run

If the application's window is found, jump to this window, otherwise,
launch the application with command.

1.  Common usage

        (exwmx-quickrun "firefox")
    
    Note: \`exwmx-quickrun' **need** appconfigs stored in
    \`exwmx-appconfig-file', user should store appconfigs of
    frequently used applications by yourself with the help
    of \`exwmx-appconfig'.

2.  Define an alias

    Search an appconfig which :alias is "web-browser", and run this
    appconfig's :command.
    
        (exwmx-quickrun "web-browser" t)

3.  Adjust window ruler

        (exwmx-quickrun "firefox" nil '(:class :instance :title))
    
    or
    
        (exwmx-quickrun "firefox" nil '(:class "XXX" :instance "XXX" :title "XXX"))


<a id="org9c08200"></a>

### Dmenu

\`exwmx-dmenu' let user input or select a command in minibuffer, and execute it.

\`exwmx-dmenu' support some command prefixes:

1.  ",command": run "command" in terminal emulator, for example,
    ",top" will execute a terminal emulator, then run shell command: "top" .
    
    Note: user can change terminal emulator by variable \`exwmx-terminal-emulator'.

2.  ";command": run an emacs command which name is exwmx:"command".
3.  "-Num1Num2": split window top-to-bottom, for example,
    the result of command "-32" is: 3 windows on top and 2 windows in buttom.
4.  "|Num1Num2": split window left-to-right, for example,
    the result of command "|32" is: 3 windows at left and 2 window at right.

User can customize the prefixes of \`exwmx-dmenu' with the help of
\`exwmx-dmenu-prefix-setting'.


<a id="org15a62c8"></a>

### Sendstring

\`exwmx-sendstring' let user send a string to application, it is a simple
tool but very useful, for example:

1.  Find a Unicode character then search it to with google.
2.  Input Chinese without install ibus, fcitx or other external input method,
    just use emacs's buildin input method, for example: chinese-pyim, chinese-py,
    a good emergency tools :-)
3.  Write three line emacs-lisp example and send it to github.
4.  Draw an ascii table with table.el and send it to BBC.
5.  &#x2026;&#x2026;

when run \`exwmx-sendstring', a buffer will be poped up to let user edit.
after run command \`exwmx-sendstring-finish', the content of the buffer will
be sent to the input field of current application.

\`exwmx-sendstring-from-minibuffer' is a simple version of \`exwmx-sendstring',
it use minibuffer to get input.

\`exwmx-sendstring&#x2013;send' can send a string to application, it is used by elisp.

NOTE: if \`exwmx-sendstring' can not work well with an application, user
should set :paste-key of this application with the help of \`exwmx-appconfig'.


<a id="org93c8109"></a>

### Others

1.  \`exwmx-shell-command': run a shell command.
2.  \`exwmx-terminal-emulator': run a shell command in a terminal emulator.

1.  Config melpa repository, please seeï¼š<http://melpa.org/#/getting-started>
2.  M-x package-install RET exwm-x RET


<a id="org150da99"></a>

## Configure


<a id="org7727ab0"></a>

### Add exwm-x directory to emacs's load-path

Pasting the below line to "~/.emacs" is a simple way.

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/exwm-x")


<a id="org1ecbd7d"></a>

### Edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file

You should edit "~/.initrc" file or "~/.xsession" file like below example:

    
    # Fallback cursor
    # xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr
    
    # Keyboard repeat rate
    # xset r rate 200 60
    
    xhost +SI:localuser:$USER
    
    exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs --eval '(require (quote exwmx-loader))'


<a id="org89394d3"></a>

### Make "~/.initrc" or "~/.xsession" excutable

    chmod a+x ~/.xsession

or

    chmod a+x ~/.initrc


<a id="org9f3106b"></a>

### Edit "~/.exwm-x"

Add your exwm config to this file, for example:

    (require 'exwm)
    (require 'exwm-x)
    (require 'exwmx-xfce)
    (require 'exwmx-example)
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t v") 'exwmx:file-browser)
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t f") 'exwmx:web-browser)
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t e") 'exwmx:emacs)
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t c") 'exwmx-xfce-terminal)
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t z") 'exwmx-floating-hide-all)
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t C-c") 'exwmx-xfce-new-terminal)
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t b") 'exwmx-switch-application)
    
    (exwmx-input-set-key (kbd "C-t C-f") 'exwmx-floating-toggle-floating)


<a id="org796f9b1"></a>

## Usage


<a id="org1e6935e"></a>

### Build appconfig database

When user **first** login in EXWM-X desktop environment,
appconfigs of frequently used applications should be added
to appconfig database file: \`exwmx-appconfig-file',
it is simple but **very very** important, for many useful commands
of EXWM-X need this database file, for example:
\`exwmx-quickrun', \`exwmx-sendstring' and so on.

user should do like the below:

1.  Launch an application with \`exwmx-dmenu'.
2.  Run command \`exwmx-appconfig'.
3.  Edit appconfig template
4.  Save
5.  Launch another application with \`exwmx-dmenu'.
6.  &#x2026;&#x2026;.


<a id="orgff643d0"></a>

### The usage of "exwmx-example"

"exwmx-example" is EXWM-X buildin example, user can use it to
test EXWM-X's features, the following is its keybindings.
by the way, EXWM-X is a EXWM derivative, most EXWM commands
can be used too :-)

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Key</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">command</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-t ;"</td>
<td class="org-left">exwmx-dmenu</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-t C-e"</td>
<td class="org-left">exwmx-sendstring</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-t C-r"</td>
<td class="org-left">exwmx-appconfig</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-t 1"</td>
<td class="org-left">exwmx-switch-to-1-workspace</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-t 2"</td>
<td class="org-left">exwmx-switch-to-2-workspace</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-t 3"</td>
<td class="org-left">exwmx-switch-to-3-workspace</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-t 4"</td>
<td class="org-left">exwmx-switch-to-4-workspace</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">"C-x o"</td>
<td class="org-left">switch-window</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If exwmx-example doesn't suit for your need, just copy and paste
its useful pieces to your "~/.exwm-x" file.

If user want to full override exwmx-example, a simple way is setting
like the below line **before load exwmx-loader**.

    (defvar exwmx-default-example)
    (setq exwmx-default-example 'your-own-example)


<a id="org30cc18b"></a>

## Issues

1.  When exwmx-xfce is enabled, header-line of floating window will
    dispear when move it to another workspace.
